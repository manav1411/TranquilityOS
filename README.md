Notes to self:
- don't build an arbitrary OS that mimics those already built, but something that actually has a purpose and novelty - demonstrates ability to build complex systems, not just following instructions. might not be relevant at the start.
- explicitly document design tradeoffs to demonstrate thinking beyond following instructions
